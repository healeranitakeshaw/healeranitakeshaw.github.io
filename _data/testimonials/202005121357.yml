message: "I am tremendously lucky and deeply grateful to have met Healer Anita Keshaw.\r\nIn 2019 I was in the Osho International Meditation Resort in Pune/India doing a 21-days meditation course called Mystic Rose where one has a safe space to laugh daily for three hours in the first week and cry daily for three hours in the second one. But I was not able to cry. Instead I mostly just sat there silently, looking peaceful on the outside, but inside was battling with myself, the facilitators and the participants, frustrated and not nice to myself of not being able to cry for a whole week and of having lots of negative thoughts of blaming, judging and not accepting everyone. I partially blamed the facilitators, didn't really resonate with most of the participants and did a multi day Vipassana meditation course right before, which I wouldn't recommend, as it's a totally different approach of accessing and letting go of suppressed emotions - strongly expressing (Osho Mystic Rose) versus silently witnessing (Vipassana).\r\nIt was around the end of the course when I met Healer Anita. She took lots of time and patience to listen to my course experience and journey. With lots of loving kindness, compassion, understanding and respect she helped me understand why I was not able to cry - as I have suppressed my emotions for more than 20 years and have been disconnected from my heart and subconscious - and how to be more kind, understanding and gentle to myself and when she accessed and shared something from my subconscious, something I had suppressed and haven't been able to access, lots of tears started to flow and I was both crying but also tremendously happy, thankful and grateful for having met Anita.\r\nShe directly pointed to the root cause, which I wasn't able to access and I have tried a lot of things to access it: I have sat a lot of 10-day Vipassana meditation courses, in different centres and countries, sat several 8-day Satipatthana Sutta deepening meditation courses, did also the 7-day No-Mind meditation course in above mentioned Osho Resort, had tried many different psychoactive substances and had likely more than thousand psychedelic journeys. I did a lot of yoga, read a lot of and listened to a lot of teachings from Buddha, Osho, Tolle, Sadhguru, Mooji, Thich Nhat Hanh etc. since I came in contact with meditation and spirituality in 2014. I started to change my life by letting go of people, started drinking purified vitalized water, eating healthier, doing more yoga, letting go of alcohol and porn, changing jobs to have more freedom over where and when I work, focussing more  inwards, but still haven't really been able to access my heart, my suppressed emotions, my subconscious without the use of mind-altering substances or being for many days in a meditation retreat.\r\nSince the day I met Anita, my subconscious is heard, my heart is slowly opening up, all kinds of suppressed emotions - especially lots of sadness, frustration and anger - are coming to the surface. It can be overwhelming at times, challenging and exhausting, but I am after a very long time able to cry, able to feel more and more emotions again, slowly reconnecting to my heart and all that thanks to Anita and her warm, positive, authentic and humble nature.\r\nAnita understands me far better and deeper than I am and anyone else is able to.\r\nI can open up to her completely as she makes me feel completely safe, respected and accepted as a whole. She makes me feel home.\r\nAnd if you are a seeker of truth I encourage you to check out her shared content and/or ask her your deepest questions and you will be in speechless awe as your heart will recognize the ultimate truth in her answers.\r\nIn deepest gratitude \U0001F64F\U0001F3FC\r\nDaniel"
